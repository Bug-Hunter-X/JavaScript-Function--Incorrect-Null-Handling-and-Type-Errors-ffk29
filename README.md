# JavaScript Function: Incorrect Null Handling and Type Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: incorrect handling of null values and potential type errors.

The `foo` function attempts to add two numbers, but it does not handle cases where one or both inputs are null or of an unexpected type.

The solution demonstrates a more robust way to handle these cases, ensuring type safety and preventing unexpected behavior.
